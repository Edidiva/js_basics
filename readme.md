6. In a statically typed language, the type of a variable is determined at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime. This means that if a variable is declared as an integer, for example, it can only store integer values and cannot store values of other data types. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, and C++.
In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change during the execution of the program. This means that a single variable can store values of different data types at different times. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.
7. undefined is a value that is assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. When a variable is declared, but has not been assigned a value, its value is automatically set to undefined.
null, on the other hand, is an assignment value. It represents a deliberate non-value, and it can be assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value.
